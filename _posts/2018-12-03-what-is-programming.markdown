Nowadays, a computer program exist almost everywhere, your smartphone, TV, laptop, or even your watch has some program in it. Being able to run computer program makes all these devices a computer.

## Arithmetic

Here's an example of a simple addition code snippet written in a language called Ruby:
{% highlight ruby %}
2 + 3 #=> return 5
{% endhighlight %}

From the snippet above, `+` is the **operator** and `2` and `3` are the **operand**, and this is an addition operation. We as human can easily understand the snippet above without having to have knowledge in programming. However, computer won't understand 

## Programming Language
Programming language is just like human language, it's being used to express ideas.
