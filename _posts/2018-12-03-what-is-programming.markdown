> Programming is about instructing computers to carry out tasks by writing computer program.

### Computer program

Computer program is constructed by **code**, it will be transformed into a list of **instruction set** for computer to follow.

Nowadays, a computer program exist almost everywhere, your smartphone, TV, laptop, or even your watch has some program in it. Being able to run computer program makes all these devices a computer.

### Code & Binary

Here's an example of a simple code snippet
{% highlight ruby %}
2 + 3 #=> return 5
{% endhighlight %}

Human can simply understand the code above, but computer can't, it only understands **binary**. Binary is a number system that is only made up of two numbers: 0 and 1.

### Arithmetic

Let's start from a basic concept, arithmetic, you've probably learned this at kindergarten.

Here's an example of a simple addition code snippet written in a language called Ruby:
{% highlight ruby %}
2 + 3 #=> return 5
{% endhighlight %}

From the snippet above, `+` is the **operator** and `2` and `3` are the **operand**, and this is an addition operation. We as human can easily understand the snippet above without having to have knowledge in programming. However, computer won't understand

### Programming Language

Programming language is just like human language, it's being used to express ideas.

#### TODO

- Symbol
- Binary
- Abstraction
- AST
