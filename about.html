    <p>
        Hi, my name is Cheah Jer Fei, or you can call me Jeff. I've been writing software for the past 4 years and I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at Seek Asia. Recently, I also started my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science at University of London.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've always wanted to write good code, and I think funtional programming and a good type system are the right tools to help achieve this. Therefore, I'm learning Haskell and looking for an opportunity to use it at work.
    </p>
    <p>I also believe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correctness_(computer_science)" target="_blank">correctness</a></span> of program. Therefore, I'm keen to explore topics like Type Theory and Proof Assistant.
