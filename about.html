    <p>
        Hi, my name is Jeff and I'm based in Malaysia. I've been writing software for the past 4 years and I'm currently
        working as a Haskell Consultant at MLabs.
    </p>
    <p>
        My main interest is to make it easier to write quality software through different technologies like functional
        programming, type system, tests, and/or proof. Therefore, I'm looking to further my studies to do research in
        topics like Type Theory and Proof Assistant.
