title: Writing correct software is hard
draft: true
---

Software quality is important (to some extent) in the industry but writing correct software is hard

why does it mean to be correct
  - formal definition
  - it's impossible and not cost effective
  - we need to at least make it partially correct

why is it hard
  - malformed or unexpected data is representable
  - eliminate via type system
  - lack of abstraction power & not composable
  - more powerful type system

conclusion
  - making it easy to write correct code is not enough
  - we want to make it hard to write incorrect code
